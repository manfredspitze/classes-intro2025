Okay, here are instructions for your 11th and 12th-grade students for their coding exam on creating a simple Python class, drawing inspiration from the `Book`, `Car`, and `Student` examples but without giving away the specific code:

**Python Class Creation Exam - Inspired by Real-World Objects**

This exam will assess your understanding of object-oriented programming principles by having you create a Python class that models a familiar real-world object or concept. You will define its characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

**Objective:**

You will design and implement a Python class that represents a specific object or concept, including its essential data and at least one action it can perform.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Choose Your Object/Concept:**
    * Select a real-world object or concept that can be described by several key pieces of information and can perform at least one action. Think about the examples we explored in our PRIMM activities (`Book`, `Car`, `Student`), but you are encouraged to choose something different if you have a clear idea.
    * Examples of potential objects/concepts (these are just suggestions, feel free to be creative!):
        * A `Rectangle` (with attributes like `length`, `width`)
        * A `Circle` (with attributes like `radius`)
        * A `BankAccount` (with attributes like `account_number`, `balance`)
        * A `Movie` (with attributes like `title`, `director`, `year`)
        * A `Product` (with attributes like `name`, `price`)

2.  **Class Definition:**
    * Define a Python class using the `class` keyword.
    * Choose a clear and descriptive name for your class that reflects the object or concept you've selected.

3.  **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
    * Your class must include an `__init__` method.
    * The `__init__` method should accept at least two parameters (in addition to `self`) that will be used to set the initial state (attributes) of an object created from this class.
    * Inside the `__init__` method, assign the values passed as arguments to instance attributes using `self`. Select meaningful names for your attributes.

4.  **Attributes:**
    * Your class must have at least the two attributes initialized in the `__init__` method.
    * Consider what essential information defines your chosen object or concept. You may include additional relevant attributes if you deem them necessary for a complete representation.

5.  **Method(s):**
    * Your class must have at least one method (other than `__init__`) that defines a behavior or action associated with your object or concept.
    * This method should interact with at least one of the instance attributes of your class.
    * The method should either return a value based on its operation or perform an action that changes the state of the object (e.g., modifies an attribute) or produces output. Choose a verb-based name for your method that clearly indicates its purpose.

6.  **Instantiation and Usage:**
    * Demonstrate how to use your class by:
        * Creating at least two distinct instances (objects) of your class, providing different initial values when you create them.
        * Calling the method you defined on each of these instances.
        * Printing the value of at least one attribute for each of the created instances to show their individual states.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

* **Correct Class Structure:** Proper use of the `class` keyword and indentation.
* **Effective Initialization:** Correct implementation of the `__init__` method with appropriate parameters and attribute assignments.
* **Relevant Attributes:** Selection and naming of attributes that meaningfully describe the chosen object or concept.
* **Functional Method:** Correct definition and implementation of at least one method that performs a relevant action and uses instance attributes.
* **Proper Instantiation:** Correct creation of multiple instances of your class with different data.
* **Clear Demonstration of Usage:** Correctly calling the method(s) on the instances and accessing their attributes.
* **Code Readability:** Use of clear and descriptive names for your class, attributes, and methods.

**Important Reminders:**

* This is an individual assessment. You must write your own code.
* You may refer to your notes and any allowed resources, but communication with other students is prohibited.
* Ensure your code runs without syntax or runtime errors.
* Submit your Python code file (`.py`) as instructed.
