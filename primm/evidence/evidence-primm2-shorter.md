**Python Class Creation Exam Instructions**

This exam will test whether you know how to define and use a simple Python class.

**Objective:**

Create a Python class modeling a real-world object or concept with specific attributes and at least one method.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Class Definition:** Define a new Python class with a descriptive name.

2.  **Initialization (`__init__` method):** Implement an `__init__` method accepting at least two parameters (excluding `self`) to initialize instance attributes. Assign these parameter values to instance attributes.

3.  **Attributes:** Your class must have at least the two attributes initialized in `__init__`. Include additional relevant attributes as needed.

4.  **Method(s):** Define at least one method (other than `__init__`) that performs an action related to the class object and utilizes at least one instance attribute. This method should return a value or produce output.

5.  **Instantiation and Usage:** Demonstrate your class by:
    * Creating at least two distinct instances with different initial values.
    * Calling the defined method on each instance.
    * Printing the value of at least one attribute for each instance.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your code will be evaluated on:

* Correct class definition and syntax.
* Proper implementation of `__init__` with attribute initialization.
* Meaningful attribute selection and naming.
* Correct definition and functionality of the method(s) using instance attributes.
* Proper instantiation of class objects.
* Clear demonstration of method calls and attribute access.
* Code clarity and readability.

**Important Notes:**

* Individual work is required.
* Allowed resources may be consulted, but no communication is permitted.
* Ensure error-free code execution.
* Submit your Python code file (`.py`) as instructed.
