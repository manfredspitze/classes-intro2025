Understood. Here's the lesson plan on Python classes, structured using the PRIMM model:

Lesson Plan: Introduction to Python Classes (PRIMM Model)

Objectives:
- Students will understand the concept of classes and objects in Python.
- Students will be able to create simple classes and instantiate objects from them.
- Students will learn about class attributes, instance attributes, and methods.

Materials:
- Projector or whiteboard for demonstrations
- Coding environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a local Python IDE)

Predict (10 minutes):
- Introduce the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how it differs from procedural programming.
- Ask students to predict what a class and an object might be in the context of programming.
- Encourage students to share their ideas and expectations about how classes and objects might be used.

Run (20 minutes):
- Present the syntax for defining a class in Python, including the `class` keyword and the `__init__` method.
- Demonstrate how to create instance attributes and methods within a class, using a simple `Dog` class as an example.
- Show how to create objects (instances) from a class and access their attributes and methods.

Investigate (15 minutes):
- Explain the difference between class attributes and instance attributes.
- Demonstrate how to define and access class attributes, and discuss when to use them versus instance attributes.
- Provide students with the `Dog` class code and have them experiment with creating objects, accessing attributes, and calling methods.

Modify (15 minutes):
- Assign students a task to create a simple class of their own, such as a `Student` class or a `Rectangle` class.
- Instruct students to modify the class by adding new attributes and methods, and then create objects from their class.
- Encourage students to share their code and discuss their implementations with the class.

Make (20 minutes):
- Have students work on a practice exercise to create a more complex class of their own design.
- Encourage them to think about real-world entities they can model using classes and objects.
- Students should create their class, instantiate objects, and experiment with the class and object functionality.

Wrap-up (10 minutes):
- Summarize the key concepts covered in the lesson, including the PRIMM model and its application to learning Python classes.
- Encourage students to continue exploring and practicing with Python classes.
- Provide resources for further learning, such as online tutorials or coding challenges.
